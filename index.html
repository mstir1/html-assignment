        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Matthew Stirling, I was born on September 24<sup>th</sup>, 2003. 
        My favorite things to do is writing, playing video games and listening to music.
        The past year I took a break from school to get a job and make some money. I found a job at
     a nursing home as a housekeeper. I worked for the year and I put some of that money down for my laptop.</p>

        <p>I picked the Interactive Media Design program because I thought I would get the opportunity to 
            express myself creatively and to work with computers. I built my own desktop with my dad a couple years
            back and I took a computer class back in high school. We used an old version of Visual Studio on a Windows 7 
            computer and we coded in Flash for a bit.  
        </p>
